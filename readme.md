# Purpose #

The purpose of this repository is to inform those who wish to write assembly routines for their C code.  I have found that the compiler documentation - though adequate - is something less than desireable for the community at large to get started.

Having said that, before you go writing a ton of assembly code for C, read the compiler documentation!  Otherwise, you may write assembly code that will interfere with your compiler-generated code!
